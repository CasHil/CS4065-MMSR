First install all required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
`song_clustering.py` should work out-of-the-box, it is mainly to visualize a way to cluster different songs.
`spotify_searcher.py` requires you to register the app with [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/). You then obtain a client ID and client secret. Paste those in .env.copy and change the filename to .env.
